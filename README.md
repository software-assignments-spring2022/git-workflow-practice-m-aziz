# Robotic Process Automation

While it may occur that only blue collar jobs are being overtaken by the growing automation of robots and other smarter software systems. A recent [article](https://sdtimes.com/softwaredev/rpa-handling-mundane-tasks-freeing-up-developers/) shows a new emerging field where even current software developers are being impacted by automation technology.
The article exhibits a positive reaction to this technology as it speaks about the many mundane tasks that exists for engineers such

1. preparing a file or an integration
2. moving data from one point to another
3. doing data entry.

While these robots makes things run more smoothly, the robot cannot function without the direction of the human, which is a big flaw of these systems.

> It is interesting that the article suggests to use RPA as a communication tool between developers to save time. However, I wonder if it will serve as a disavantage to eliminate direct communication between developers. - Aila Aamir
